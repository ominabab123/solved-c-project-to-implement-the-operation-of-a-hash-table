 <li>Students will create a complete C# project to implement the operation of a hash table by addressing the following:

  <ul>

   <li>Create a flowchart to show the processing that will take place to implement the operation of a hash structure.</li>

   <li>Create a detailed and separate flowchart for the operation of the hash function (hash key generator).</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Write a complete C# program (complete project code) that will create and use a hash table algorithm to store “String” data type in the hash structure.

  <ul>

   <li>You must use a linked List to resolve potential collisions.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Submit the complete Visual Studio (C#) project folder in zipped format that includes a Word document containing the required flowcharts in step 1</li>
